# NETGEAR-WiFi-Wordlist
This is a wordlist that is optimized for faster cracking speed, and is more aligned with the actual default wireless passwords on Netgear routers.  Existing wordlists for Netgear routers ignore certain words, such as hippo, gadfly, and vanilla; these inferior wordlists instead include thousands of extra words which are counter-productive to the cracking process.

Most wordlists for Netgear routers rely on thousands of extra verbs and adjectives to fill the gap in research made.  This wordlist moves beyond that, by not only providing an extremely efficient wordlist to work off of, but also includes my research notes.  It is my belief that the serial numbers on Netgear routers are somehow used to determine the passphrase for the wireleless network.  Further research on this will be necessary, but the side product of this research is an extremely efficient wordlist for cracking default Netgear router WiFi passwords.
